# [Remembered.io](https://remembered.io/) Chrome App

Remember everything worth remembering with automated smart reminders and scientifically proven spaced repetition! Easily remember & reinforce mantras, lessons, information, ideas, facts, quotes and concepts!

## Build

Use the [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg?hl=en) to build and run the app. You can also download the repository and open the app directly with Chrome from the extensions page.

## Features

### ★ When writing it down isn't enough ★

You discover ideas you want to remember and use all the time. Sadly they're usually forgotten even when written down. You might even set some reminders using a calendar/note/todo app, but it quickly becomes too much effort.

### ★ Automated smart reminders ★

Receive up to 3 reminders per day by email with what you’re currently remembering. We use email because it works for everyone everywhere. Set an item as remembered to stop it from being included in reminders.

### ★ Spaced repetition ★

A scientifically proven way to effectively remember information. We send items at the best time by increasing the interval between reminders to maximize the psychological spacing effect.

### ★ Organize & track progress ★

See how consistently you read reminders (don’t break the chain!) and how many items you’ve remembered. Use tags for organizing and monitoring progress in specific areas.

### ★ Become who you want to be ★

Today, life moves so quickly it’s easy to lose sight of what you truly want. Keeping what you actually want to remember top of mind helps you make better decisions and achieve those goals that are often just a few steps away.
